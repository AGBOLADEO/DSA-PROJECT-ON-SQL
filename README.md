### Question 11....

If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and 
Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company 
appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? (Explain your answer)

SELECT  
    Order_Priority,  
    Ship_Mode,  
    SUM(Shipping_Cost) AS Total_Cost  
FROM [dbo].KMSORDER 
WHERE Ship_Mode IN ('Express Air', 'Delivery Truck')  
GROUP BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode  
ORDER BY Ship_Mode, Total_Cost DESC

ANSWER: Based on Order Priority				Ship Mode					Total Cost

		Low									Delivery Truck				$1,659.14
		High								Delivery Truck				$1,274.98

		Not	Specified						Delivery Truck				$1,040.76

		Medium								Delivery Truck				$925.25

		Critical							Delivery Truck				$829.01

		Low									Express Air					$289.95

	Not	Specified						Express Air					$257.40

	Critical							Express Air					$195.19

	Medium								Express Air					$167.27

High								Express Air					$108.92

Was shipping cost appropriately spent based on Order Priority?

a- Appropriate spending depends on matching high-priority orders with fast (Express Air) shipping and low-priority orders with economical (Delivery Truck) methods.

b- If there are mismatches (e.g., urgent items shipped via Delivery Truck), the spending is inappropriate.

c- A proper audit of the data would confirm alignment.
